## mission

compsigh is a computer science club at the university of san francisco focused on bringing social connection back to cs, as well as bringing cs at usf up to par with the real world — collaborative experiences, meaningful projects, and embracing the mentality of always learning.

here's how we do that:

- design and host student-run events;
- learn meaningful industry skills through workshops;
- apply those skills, getting a head start on our portfolios;
- dramatically increase engagement within cs; and
- take charge of our education by working with the department on improving cs at usf.

we believe we ought to be active participants to enjoy what can be an incredibly fulfilling career path. since fall 2022, we’ve hosted two major events, participated in and won the biggest hackathon of the 2022–2023 school year, and have become the largest cs club on campus at a third of the entire major with us on discord.

in short, we're here to `💛 make cs fun again ✨`

## get involved

we welcome usf students of all majors 🙏
