compsigh is a social computer science club at the University of San Francisco for meeting cool people and building cool things. We host high-quality, low-stakes events, and engage in a vibrant, family-like community.

## get involved

We welcome USF students of all majors 🙏

Join our [Discord](https://discord.compsigh.so) to hang out, make friends, and check in on when our next in-person event is 🗓️

If you're not a USF student, we have a couple open-source projects we'd welcome your contributions on 🏗️
